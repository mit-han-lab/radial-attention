### [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19852) | [Website](https://hanlab.mit.edu/projects/radial-attention)

**[2025-08-04]** Radial Attention is now supports [Lightx2v](https://github.com/ModelTC/LightX2V), a 4-step LoRA. Radial Attention also supports [SageAttention2++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21136) for FP8 Matmul accumulation on 4090. With the joint effort of **Radial Attention, SageAttention and Lightx2v LoRA**, now it only takes **33/90 seconds to generate a high-fidelity video for Wan2.1 on a single H100/4090 GPU respectively!**.

**[2025-07-22]** Radial Attention is now compatible with [SageAttention](https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention) version 2!

**[2025-07-14]** Radial Attention is now compatible with [SageAttention](https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention) version 1!

**[2025-07-03]** Radial Attention now supports [Wan2.1_14B_FusionX LoRA](https://huggingface.co/vrgamedevgirl84/Wan14BT2VFusioniX)! You can get high-quality videos within just 8 steps (90 seconds on a single H100 GPU)!

**[2025-06-24]** Radial Attention is open-sourced! Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi-1 are supported for fast video generation with high quality under 1-4⨉ video length.

We present *Radial Attention*, a sparse attention mechanism with $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ computational complexity. Radial Attention accelerates pre-trained HunyuanVideo by 1.9× at its default video length while maintaining comparable video quality. When generating 4× longer videos, it reduces tuning costs by up to 4.4× and speeds up inference by up to 3.7× versus dense attention.

## 📖Overview

![teaser](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa69414b-8d7e-4ba5-9b9f-9dcb4bb3cf90)

**Radial Attention** is a **scalable sparse attention mechanism** for video diffusion models that translates **Spatiotemporal Energy Decay**—observed in attention score distributions—into exponentially decaying compute density. Unlike $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ dense attention  or linear approximations, Radial Attention achieves **$\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ complexity** while preserving expressive power for long videos. Here are our core contributions.

- **Physics-Inspired Sparsity**: Static masks enforce *spatially local* and *temporally decaying* attention, mirroring energy dissipation in physical systems.
- **Efficient Length Extension**: Pre-trained models (e.g., Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo) scale to **4× longer videos** via lightweight LoRA tuning, avoiding full-model retraining.

## 🔍Sparsity Pattern Design

![patterns](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e572cc5-27f3-4b24-bc0e-7d0a9d0b3cde)

**(a)** The compute density pattern. The attention map is divided into $2\lceil\log_2(\max(f, 2))\rceil - 1$ bands (here, the number of frames $f = 12$) based on the temporal distance between tokens. The central band has full compute density, while each successive outer band has half the density of the previous one. Except for band $\pm1$, each band also doubles the diagonal width of its predecessor.  
**(b)** The corresponding attention mask for (a). The compute density is reflected in the compute diagonal width of each frame-to-frame block. When the diagonal width drops below 1, we reduce the frequency of diagonals. We additionally add an attention sink.  
**(c)** An example mask used in HunyuanVideo, illustrating the final sparsity pattern in practice.

## 📊Performance

![results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/861ffe21-3365-4bf3-abb1-852d4f20bc8d)

**Radial Attention** reduces the computational complexity of attention from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$. When generating a 500-frame 720p video with HunyuanVideo, it reduces the attention computation by 9×, achieves 3.7× speedup, and saves 4.6× tuning costs.
